# FrozedHider

A Minecraft plugin that uses the WorldGuard API to hide players within designated regions. When a player enters a
specified WorldGuard region, they become invisible to other players, and upon exiting, they are revealed again. This is
all done with packets, so players are not removed from the Tablist.

## Features

- Lightweight and easy to use.
- Hide players in configurable WorldGuard regions using the `hide-player` flag.

## Dependencies

- PaperSpigot (1.21.1+)
- [WorldGuard v7.0.13](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard/files/6201343/download)

## Building

To build the project, you will need:

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven

Clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/FrozedClub/frozedhider/releases).
2. Place the `frozedhider-1.0.0.jar` file in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart or reload your server.

## Configuration

The configuration is located in `plugins/FrozedHider/config.yml`.

```yaml
# This will show a message on chat when a player enters or exits a region.
debug: false
```

## Usage & Permissions

To hide players in a WorldGuard region, you need to set the `hide-player` flag on the region.

If you want to see debug messages in the console, set `debug` to `true` in the configuration file.

If you want a player to stay hidden after they leave the region, you can use the `frozedhider.stay-hidden` permission.

If you want to see hidden players inside the region, you can use the `frozedhider.view-all` permission.

If you want staff players to see other staff players inside the region, you can use the `frozedhider.view-staff` permission.

If you want a player to be considered as staff, you can use the `frozedhider.staff` permission.
